# PancakeSwap-API
Use this API to fetch token data from PancakeSwap and use it within your Unity Game / Application

## HOW DOES IT WORK? 

Let's have a look at fetching token data ðŸ˜„  ! For this example we'll be using PancakeSwap. You can use the demo scene to load data for any token on Pancakeswap (https://cryptocointracker.com/api/pancakeswap/get/api-v2-tokens-address)

The scene should be drag, drop, play.  I'll attach the script as well for those that don't want to import an entire package.
